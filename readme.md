# Stater Boot
**`A NodeJS Nano Service Framework`** that will help
you to create a new service by starting another services.

This framework is supposed to run any services with single command,
e.g: run the build processes and then run the server, but
these services can access any service's configs, so will be
easier to configure the services.

### Requirements
* NodeJS 6.5+ (will be 7.8+ on the next release).

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @stater/boot
```

### Usage

To start using **`Stater Boot`**, you need to add
`stater-boot` property to your `package.json`.

**Example**
```json
{
  "name": "sample-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "stater-boot": {
    "main": "service.js",
    "config": "configs/service-config.js"
  }
}
```

Then you need to create a service as a bootstrap service.

**Example**

**`service.js`**
```js
class SampleService {
  beforeRun: ['sb-bower-list', 'sb-build-script'],
  beforeEnd: ['sb-store-asset', 'sb-init-server', 'sb-start-server'],

  // This function will be called when the service start,
  // after starting the beforeRun services.
  // The beforeEnd services will be started after this
  // function called.
  service(context, configs) {
    let conf = configs.get('sb-server');

    context.logs.info(`Server will be running on port ${conf.port}`);
  }
}

module.export = SampleService;
```

*The sample above is assume the services already installed,
and the created service is to run these services.*

Then you can create configs for the required services.

**Example**
**`service-config.js`**
```js
module.export = [
  {
    // Config name is required.
    name: 'sb-server',

    // Your configs is here.
    port: 8080,

    // This function will be called after all configs registered,
    // to allow you reconfigure your config that depends
    // on something else.
    reconfigure(config) {
      if (process.argv.includes('--prod')) {
        config.port = 80;
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'sb-bower-list',
    cwd: 'bower_components'
  }
];
```

To start the service, run this command:

```bash
stater-boot
```

For more usage, run this command:

```bash
stater-boot help
```
