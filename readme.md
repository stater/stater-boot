# Stater Boot
**`Micro Service Framework for NodeJS`** - A micro service manager that will help
you to create a new service by starting another services.

This framework is supposed to run any services with single command,
e.g: run the build processes and then run the server, but
these services can access any service's configs, so will be
easier to configure the services.

### Requirements
* NodeJS 6.5+ (will be 7.8+ on the next release).

***
## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @stater/boot
```

Stater Boot will have `stater-boot` and `stb` as alias on the CLI.

***
## Usage

To start using **`Stater Boot`**, you need to add
`stater-boot` property to your `package.json`.

**Example**
```json
{
  "name": "sample-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "stater-boot": {
    "main": "service.js",
    "config": "configs/service-config.js"
  }
}
```

Then you need to create a service as a bootstrap service.

**Example**

**`service.js`**
```js
class SampleService {
  beforeRun = ['sb-bower-list', 'sb-build-script'];
  beforeEnd = ['sb-store-asset', 'sb-init-server', 'sb-start-server'];

  // This function will be called when the service start,
  // after starting the beforeRun services.
  // The beforeEnd services will be started after this
  // function called.
  service(context, configs) {
    let conf = configs.get('sb-server');

    context.logs.info(`Server will be running on port ${conf.port}`);
  }
}

module.exports = SampleService;
```

*The sample above is assume the services already installed,
and the created service is to run these services.*

Then you can create configs for the required services.

**Example**
**`service-config.js`**
```js
module.exports = [
  {
    // Config name is required.
    name: 'sb-server',

    // Your configs is here.
    port: 8080,

    // This function will be called after all configs registered,
    // to allow you reconfigure your config that depends
    // on something else.
    reconfigure(config) {
      if (process.argv.includes('--prod')) {
        config.port = 80;
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'sb-bower-list',
    cwd: 'bower_components'
  }
];
```

To start the service, run this command:

```bash
stater-boot
```
or
```bash
stb
```

To start specific services, include the service(s) name
after the command. Example:

```bash
stater-boot foo bar
```
or
```bash
stb foo bar
```

**Example using command and options**:

```bash
stb foo bar -d src -c configs/stb-configs.js --debug --erroff
```

From the sample above, it run services `foo` and `bar`,
set the workding directory (`-d`) to `src` folder,
and set the config file (`-c`) to `configs/stb-configs.js`,
with debug logging (`--debug`), and keep the services running
even when some error happen (`--erroff`).


For more usage info, run this command:

```bash
stb help
```
